## Baseline Implementation

- **Reference**: *Local Differentially Private Fuzzy Counting in Stream Data using Probabilistic Data Structures*.
- **Bloom Filter**: We adopt a standard Bloom Filter without modification, as the paper does not alter its original structure. The FPR is therefore governed by its classical theory.
- **Cuckoo Filter**: Our `insert()` method corresponds directly to Algorithm 1 in the paper.
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Our `query_count()` function implements Algorithm 3 in the paper, supporting segment-wise similarity estimation and threshold-based filtering.
- **Additions**: We additionally provide segment-level frequency counters and helper methods for evaluation convenience.
- We did not implement clientâ€“server separation, since our focus is the theoretical structure.
