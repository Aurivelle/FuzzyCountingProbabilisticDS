# Implementing HyperLogLog on Fuzzy Counting

## 📈 Project Overview

This is a Final Project of the class Advanced Data Structure in NTU CSIE.

A Bloom + Cuckoo Filter baseline for typo correction

A HyperLogLog-based fuzzy matcher, implemented in both C++ and Python

LDP (Local Differential Privacy) extensions for privacy-aware sketching

A python library for use

## 🌐 Usage

Python HLL Library:

pip install hll_py
from hll_py import autocorrect

## 📅 Future Improvements

Benchmark against more real-world corpora (e.g., Wikipedia typos)

Add visualization and streamable CLI tool

Explore compression or adaptive memory scaling techniques
